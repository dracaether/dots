# dots
repository for my dots on my Arch Linux set up.

----
### Introduction
Hello there! These dots are not, in any shape or form, made entirely from scratch. Everyone has to start somewhere, right?

>_Sir, I donâ€™t know what you heard, but whatever it is, Jefferson started it._

Feel free to open an issue if there are problems, or if you have something to ask. I'll admit, this is my first time doing these kinds of stuff, so go easy on me now [insert emoji here, yadda yadda].

### dots and system information
- These dots were configured for [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), although you can modify it to your heart's content. If you want, make a version for i3 and other existing wms and... branch it I guess. I know not everyone uses bspwm.

- If you find this repo via [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn), then I guess you know what distro I use. But if not, I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) - although that didn't matter much, does it? As long as you have bspwm running, my dots will work on your setup.

- I use [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) since it's easier to configure, in my opinion.

- Colorschemes are configured via [colormind](http://colormind.io/image/).

- There are two versions of my bspwmrc: one is for my main laptop + external monitor workstation and the other is for my second laptop (aka the laptop I test things with haha). If you have more than two... well, do `xrandr -q` and modify the bspwmrc file.

- Remember to uncomment anything you wanted to try and use. Most of my modifications are commented to avoid messing up your stuff in case something happens.
