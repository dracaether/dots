# dots
repository for my dots on my Arch Linux set up. [underconstruction]

----
### Introduction
Hello there! These dots are not, in any shape or form, made entirely from scratch. Everyone has to start somewhere, right?

These dots were configured for [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), although you are free to make a version for i3 and other wms.

### 'I wanna give you a word of warning...'
>_Sir, I donâ€™t know what you heard, but whatever it is, Jefferson started it._

Feel free to open an issue if there are problems, or if you have something to ask. I'll admit, this is my first time doing these kinds of stuff, so go easy on me now [insert emoji here, yadda yadda].

This repository has dots for [initially]:

- .config

  - bspwmrc
  
  - sxhkdrc
  
  - polybar
  
  
- .Xresources

- .Xdefaults

- .fehbg (you don't have to download this, but this is what's written on my bspwmrc file)


#### NOTE: Others will be added as I see fit. You may or may not use them. 
Some will be uploaded per request (for example, wallpapers, scripts, etc.)
