# dots
repository for my dots on my Arch Linux set up. [underconstruction]

### Introduction
Hello there! These dots are not, in any shape or form, made entirely from scratch. Everyone has to start somewhere, right?

These dots were configured for [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), although you are free to make a version for i3 and other wms.

Feel free to open an issue if there are problems, or if you have something to ask. I'll admit, this is my first time doing these kinds of stuff, so go easy on me now :P
